    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 20, 2025</p>

    <p>
      By downloading or using the Baby TapTime app (the "Application"), you
      agree to the following terms. The Application is provided by Drake Rogers
      ("Service Provider") as a paid app for entertainment purposes. Use of the
      app implies acceptance of these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      The Application is intended for personal, non-commercial use. You may not
      copy, modify, reverse engineer, or redistribute the app or its contents
      without prior written permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>

    <p>
      Baby TapTime does not collect personal data or connect to the internet. It
      functions entirely offline and does not transmit any data to the developer
      or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Device Responsibility</h2>

    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining your device and ensuring the app runs
      as intended. The developer is not responsible for performance issues
      resulting from low battery, software modifications (like jailbreaking), or
      device incompatibilities.
    </p>

    <h2>App Updates</h2>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may update the app from time to time to add features
      or fix issues. You are encouraged to install updates to ensure proper
      functionality. The developer may discontinue support at any time without
      notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Use</h2>

    <p>
      This app is designed for children with adult supervision. No personal
      information is collected, and parents or guardians are encouraged to
      enable <em>Guided Access</em> on iOS devices to restrict screen access
      while the app is in use.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>

    <p>
      Use of the app may be discontinued at any time. If the app is removed from
      sale or updated significantly, continued use of the current version is at
      your discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may update these Terms from time to time. Any changes
      will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Application means you
      accept the updated terms.
    </p>
